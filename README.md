# GPROF-gauge

This repository contains the codes for the paper "Evaluation of Global Precipitation Measurement Rainfall Estimates against Three Dense Gauge Networks" (10.1175/JHM-D-17-0174.1) in the Journal of Hydrometeorology by Jackson Tan, Walter A. Petersen, Gottfried Kirchengast, David C. Goodrich, and David B. Wolff.

The Python codes here allow anyone to perform the analysis described in the paper, matching the GPROF and DPR footprints to the three gauge networks and extracting the precipitation values for investigation. Please feel free to direct any queries on the science and analysis performed by these codes to jackson.tan@nasa.gov.

This code was run in Python 3.6.3. Other than the standard modules, it also requires numpy and h5py.
